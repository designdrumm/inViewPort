Note that the plugin _does not remove the classname_ once the target element is scrolled out of view again.\r\n\r\nUsage: `$(selector).inviewport(options)`, where options is an object which may contain two properties: `threshold` and `className`:\r\n\r\n    $('#target').inviewport({\r\n      threshold: 75, \r\n      className: 'myClass'\r\n    })\r\n\r\n`threshold` sets the minimum percentage of the element which has to be in view before the class gets added. Defaults to 100. \r\n\r\n`className` sets the name of the class. Defaults to 'in-view'.\r\n","google":"UA-42909659-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
